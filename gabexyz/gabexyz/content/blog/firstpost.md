So this is my first website, I dont know exactly what I will be posting but it will probably be revolving around talks and projects. A little about me is that Im studying computer science, I have been getting very interested about many different subjects lately that include math, algorithms and deep learning. I'm fascinated by areas of study like AI and I plan to incorporate these interests into my projects.
